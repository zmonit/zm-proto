## Note on building
Do NOT run '$make code'.

This would trigger zproject's generation of the following line
    <model name = "zm_proto" codec="zproto_codec_c" />
using zproto's c codec. 

Becuase of cffi python bindings, we have 
 * 'api/zm_proto.api' that generates include/zm_proto.h header file
 * corresponding c file 'src/zm_proto.c' is generated using zproto's C codec 
 * zm_proto_utils.(h|c), generated by zproject's CLASS element, that contain
   all the missing functions in include/zm_proto.h to which we are used to if
   the file was generated by zproto's C coded.
